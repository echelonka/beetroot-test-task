    {"id": "Rapid population growth", "group": 3, "text": "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish."},
    {"id": "Lack of social welfare", "group": 2, "text": "The lack of a proper social welfare system has left many of our elderly folks in a vulnerable position especially for those who have no family support. They have to toil hard and probably work till they die.\n\nThose with illnesses suffer more as they could not go out to work and that’s probably why also the suicide rate among our elderly remains consistently high compared to other age group."},
    {"id": "Political neglect", "group": 2, "text": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aenean commodo ligula eget dolor. Aenean massa. Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus. Donec quam felis, ultricies nec, pellentesque eu, pretium quis, sem. Nulla consequat massa quis enim. Donec pede justo, fringilla vel, aliquet nec, vulputate eget, arcu. In enim justo, rhoncus ut, imperdiet a, venenatis vitae, justo."},

    {"id": "Large social housing projects", "group": 2, "text": "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful."},
    {"id": "Growing up in high crime area", "group": 2},
    {"id": "Depression", "group": 5, "text": "Depression is classified as a mood disorder. It may be described as feelings of sadness, loss, or anger that interfere with a person’s everyday activities.\n\nIt’s also fairly common. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 8.1 percent of American adults ages 20 and over had depression in any given two-week period from 2013 to 2016."},
    {"id": "Family conditions", "group": 4, "text": "The scholarly evidence suggests that at the heart of the explosion of crime in America is the loss of the capacity of fathers and mothers to be responsible in caring for the children they bring into the world. This loss of love and guidance at the intimate levels of marriage and family has broad social consequences for children and for the wider community. The empirical evidence shows that too many young men and women from broken families tend to have a much weaker sense of connection with their neighborhood and are prone to exploit its members to satisfy their unmet needs or desires."},
    {"id": "Influence of Media", "group":  4, "text": "The influence of mass media has an effect on many aspects of the human life. This can include: voting a certain way, individual views and beliefs, or even false information that can skew a person's knowledge of a specific topic. Media is an ever-changing field and is being critiqued now more than ever by the general public."},
    {"id": "Poverty", "group": 2, "text": "Economic deprivation or simply poverty is a major cause of crime all around the world. People are often driven to great lengths of desperation by poverty and this is a major cause of crime all around the world. The fact that such frustration is created is in itself a very dangerous thing for society on the whole as global inflation has risen significantly over the last few years. Although it does seem that in our world today, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer."},
    {"id": "TV violence", "group": 4, "text": "TV violence has gone up to staggering levels and it does not help when people are influenced and try to emulate such acts of violence. TV violence is a major cause of crime especially among younger people that are unable to differentiate between fiction and reality. Since TV has become such an integral part of people’s lives now days, it is important to draw clear lines between what is real and what is not."},
    {"id": "Drugs", "group": 3, "text": "Drugs are a bane, no matter how we look at them. A person addicted to drugs is unable to support their addiction and more often than not they end up in a life of crime to fuel their habits. It is not unknown anywhere in the world that a drug addict ends up committing crimes to raise money for their habits. Besides that there are also a large number of people that are involved in the drug trade. Though these people may not really be drug users themselves, they often lure others into drugs and crimes."}
